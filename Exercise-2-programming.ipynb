    "# Exercise 2 - Programming assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will practice network analysis and spatial accessibility modelling. Our overall goal is to analyze healthcare accessibility by conducting a two-step floating catchment area analysis in Helsinki Region. We will calculate travel time-based catchment areas by driving (10 minutes threshold) from selected hospitals and postal code areas in the Helsinki Region. Based on the population information and the number of physicians at given hospital (simulated --> not real), we can calculate an accessibility index based on 2SFCA method. The end result should look something like following:\n",

    "The main point in this Exercise is to practice how to do network analysis in Python, and use it for a practical health-related research question. Similar approaches can be used for many different applications that require understanding supply and demand of some kind of service (can be e.g. commercial application as well).\n",

The distribution of the number of doctors working in different facilities looks like this (the size of the bubble corresponds the number of physicians):\n",

    "Notice that this data **is not real** and it has been simulated based on openly available data/information and has many assumptions (e.g. that the number of doctors in cities reflect the average of whole Finland which is 3.8 doctors per 1000 inhabitants). The physicians are allocated to different facilities based on relative number of health-related employees working at different postal code areas (again a big assumption). These steps have been taken to make the data a bit more realistic, but they cannot be considered to reflect reality.

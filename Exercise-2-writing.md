# Exercise 2 - Written assignment

In the *Human wellbeing and capabilities* and *Network analytics and spatial accessibility modelling* lessons this week, we went through concepts related to equity, justice and spatial accessibility and learned how spatial network analysis can be used to quantify access. 

For this exercise, we recommend that you first write your text into Google Docs (or some other text editor), and once you are ready, paste the text into this Markdown document located at **your personal copy of the exercise** (e.g. `exercise-1-htenkanen`). You can add your text here using the editing functionalities of GitHub: click the pencil icon on the top-right side of this document (it will start an editor), then modify this document, and commit (i.e. save) your changes (to be able to do that, you need to add a commit message like `Update docs`). 

**Note for those doing the exercise in pairs**:

Only the `code ninja` should be cloning the Exercise repository as she/he/they will the **lead** on this exercise. The `philosopher`, i.e. you who will be leading the work for this written assignment should ask the `code ninja` to provide you [collaboration access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to their copy of the Exercise. See more information from the [course page](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/pair-programming.html).  

## Equity and accessibility (10 points)

Write 1-2 pages of text in English where you explain:
 
 - How philosophies of justice and concept of accessibility relate to each other?
   - how justice and equity can be understood (e.g. Rawlsian view)?
 - How spatial accessibility can be modelled and what kind of application areas there exists?
 - How equity and spatial accessibility modelling relates to sustainability?
 
Use the lesson materials and the recommended readings (optional) as a source of information for answering to these.

### My answer

Philosophy of justice is a social concept based on geographical, ethical, moral and political environment which are aggregately quite similar in different societies as all aims fairest distribution but still perceived differently in different contexts in defining the distribution and under different contexts such as political, social and even religious. Most of our elaboration of justice in western society came from Aristotle which is more biased towards distributive justice system for distribution and allocation of resources among individuals but retributive in case of penalty. Even talking about the fairness of procedural justice, the notion implies similar horizon of justice to a good extent but considering the inputs rather than output of the procedures. When we see the philosophy behind the term accessibility, it is an opportunity to access different opportunities i.e. accessing a place in terms of transport which still can be assessed in various ways, accessing education in terms of educational accessibility and so on. So, it is a divide of resources to individual at citizen level. So, the whole scenario can be correlated in terms of accessibility (transport) as when every individual have equal access to access the opportunities, implies the implementation of justice (fair distribution pattern whatever the type it is, i.e. egalitarian, capabilities approach, distributive or any other). So we can directly relate and even integrate the philosophical context of the both terminologies in single context.
Rawls view about the justice and equity can be traced from the Michael Sandel's viewpoint as I mentioned during the class. So, John Rawls perspective on justice is quite realistic to current morals of the modern societies. As the capabilities of every individual can revealed through similar filters (i.e. comparing the capability of a fish to climb a tree to a monkey, through criteria is the same for both), similarly normal distributive justice cannot be the best possible solution for every individual of the society. In modern society, we are facing several types of divides let’s say digital divide, divide of financial capacities and limitations of the vulnerable group of people in accessing the normal fixed public transport facilities. As a planner or administrator, though the goal is to achieve the maximum output from the limited resources, we need to provide the various groups in society with solution best for them rather than letting the special groups away from getting benefits from the resources and justifying it from some definition of justice which doesn’t justify the equity.
Spatial accessibility can be modeled by constructing networks where node and edges can represent the measures for which the accessibility is being measured through various approaches either in static or dynamic environment.  During my master’s thesis, I worked on the topic of accessibility of public transport. During that time, I learnt different narratives and approaches used in assessing the accessibility in detail. For the sake of assignment, a few approaches can be modeling the accessibility of a location (origin) to reach another location (destination) and similarly the ability of a location to be accessed from another location. Another approach is defined based on personal ability to reach a location. Such as accessibility of a vulnerable (old, wheelchaired person) to use the public transport (can be analyzed through GTFS feeds). Another perspective of modeling the accessibility is considering the time to reach a desired location through various time or cost based accessibility indicators. Accessibility through not limited to just transport can be related to numerous if not unlimited areas of life such as spatial decision making, accessing the spatial performance of virtually anything, business modeling, health, land-use planning (considering both spatial and personal perspectives (GDP comparison, educational performance and so on). 
As sustainability is a broad term, used in numerous contexts. So, it finds its direct connections to urban planning, health environment and decision making. Fairness of procedures, equitable distribution of benefits of aforementioned areas when measured in terms of spatial data through modeling finds direct connection to sustainability. Moreover, at very disaggregated level, in practice, sustainability is measured through some practices and numerical indicators of performances. To define those indicators and practices, some sustainable development goals were defined, which represents the quantitative measures to achieve specific type/context of sustainability such as 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 5 gender equality, 3 Good health and well-being and so on. Whereas equity is defined in terms of fairness of distribution of resources and responsibilities among various classes of the society. Measuring the Providing the fairness and equity in society itself is part of sustainable development goals (No 16). Hence, we can directly relate the equity and spatial accessibility modeling to the sustainability.

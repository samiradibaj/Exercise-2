# Exercise 2 - Written assignment

In the *Human wellbeing and capabilities* and *Network analytics and spatial accessibility modelling* lessons this week, we went through concepts related to equity, justice and spatial accessibility and learned how spatial network analysis can be used to quantify access. 

For this exercise, we recommend that you first write your text into Google Docs (or some other text editor), and once you are ready, paste the text into this Markdown document located at **your personal copy of the exercise** (e.g. `exercise-1-htenkanen`). You can add your text here using the editing functionalities of GitHub: click the pencil icon on the top-right side of this document (it will start an editor), then modify this document, and commit (i.e. save) your changes (to be able to do that, you need to add a commit message like `Update docs`). 

**Note for those doing the exercise in pairs**:

Only the `code ninja` should be cloning the Exercise repository as she/he/they will the **lead** on this exercise. The `philosopher`, i.e. you who will be leading the work for this written assignment should ask the `code ninja` to provide you [collaboration access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to their copy of the Exercise. See more information from the [course page](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/pair-programming.html).  

## Equity and accessibility (10 points)

Write 1-2 pages of text in English where you explain:
 
 - How philosophies of justice and concept of accessibility relate to each other?
   - how justice and equity can be understood (e.g. Rawlsian view)?
 - How spatial accessibility can be modelled and what kind of application areas there exists?
 - How equity and spatial accessibility modelling relates to sustainability?
 
Use the lesson materials and the recommended readings (optional) as a source of information for answering to these.
